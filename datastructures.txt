Data Strutures are a fundamental element of programming once I have the models of my programs figured out.

I use data structures to effificiently store information for my program and and access it 

Algorithms are instructions to be carried out by the computer.  

Data Structures and algorithms used to implement Classes and objects to create software or a function model of some real world phenomena 

Data structures specifically are a specialized format for organizing and storing data

The main role of a computer program is to store and proccess data. 

Computer programs have data models that define what data will be collected and worked on.

Data structure examples are Lists, Tuples Strings, Records, tables, dictionaries

The characteristics of data structures are Static, Dynamic, Mutable, Immutable

Every data structure has basic operations: Traversing, Searching, Insertion, Deletion.

Data Structures are used in an object oriented way


Data Structures can typically be classified at mutable or Immutable

********

Lists:

This is a type of sequence in python. The other being a tuple, the immutable cousin of lists

Lists are mutable where tuples are not 

Ordered Sequences that can hold a variety of objects 

Lists support indexing and slicing

Lists have a variety of useful methods than can be called on them

Lists can be nested in one another
